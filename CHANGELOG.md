## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.28] - 2026-03-28

### Changed
- **README.md** — Tightened PACT Dashboard descriptions across 4 locations (Currently Building, Featured Projects, All 33 Projects, ecosystem diagram): cut cosmetic feature names (Purple Reign, Royalty Protocol, BaseModal, NavLink, IntelDossier) to surface what recruiters scan for (capabilities, test count, security posture)
- **README.md** — Condensed Auto-Update API documentation: merged verbose format examples and 5-row field reference table into a single scannable zone-format table with inline field descriptions. Cuts 19 lines while preserving all integration details
- **README.md** — Total line count reduced 408 → 389 (back under 400 cap)
- **CLAUDE.md** — Version bump v0.8.27 → v0.8.28

## [0.8.27] - 2026-03-27

### Security
- **signature.svg** — Hardened root `<svg>` element: added `role="img"`, `aria-label`, `<title>`, `<desc>` for non-interactive semantics. Added security constraints comment block documenting forbidden patterns (`<script>`, `<foreignObject>`, `on*` handlers, `url()`, `@import`, external refs) — mitigates CWE-79 (XSS via SVG injection) and CWE-918 (SSRF via external resource loading)
- **README.md** — Added Security Model table inside Repo Setup section documenting SVG hardening, auto-update zone boundaries, and external badge isolation strategy

## [0.8.26] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **README.md** — New "Hard Problems" entry: SSE data layer extraction — `useSSEConnection` refactored into focused `useSSE` hook with typed `{data, error, isLoading}` state and first-class loading/error UI

### Changed
- **README.md** — PACT Dashboard descriptions updated across 4 locations (Currently Building, Featured Projects, All 33 Projects, ecosystem diagram) to reflect `useSSE` streaming architecture
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Hard Problems count 8 → 9
- **CLAUDE.md** — Version bump v0.8.25 → v0.8.26

## [0.8.25] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **signature.svg** — Stale header comment: "Subtitle text must match 'Open To' roles" contradicted CLAUDE.md v0.8.22 fix. Subtitles are brand identity titles, not job targets. Corrected to match the established constraint
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Hard Problems count drift: listed "7 deep-dive war stories" but README has 8 entries after the v0.8.24 async cleanup addition. Updated to 8

### Added
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Version Milestones: added v0.8.24 row (React hooks cleanup, SVG instruction sharpening)
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Content Strategy Evolution: synced through v0.8.24, added v0.8.25 entry as current

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md** — Version bump v0.8.24 → v0.8.25

## [0.8.24] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **README.md** — New "Hard Problems" entry: async cleanup in React animation hooks — documented `useIdleAnimations`/`useTerminal`/`useSSEConnection` timer leak fixes using ref-based unmount guards

### Changed
- **README.md** — Repo Setup replication instructions: sharpened step 3 (explicit hex values + element classes) and step 5 (added GFM renderer alternative to `grip`)

## [0.8.23] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **FOR_DARE.md** — File Cross-References & Editability map: dependency graph showing how all 5 files reference each other, with editability matrix and breakage risk ratings per file
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Pre-Push Quick Check: condensed 5-item fast-path checklist for Passion Agent's rapid iteration cycles (version chain, metric consistency, Content Strategy sync, showcase URL, line count)
- **README.md** — "How It Works" architecture summary in Repo Setup collapsed section — explains the zero-build-step rendering pipeline and agent write zones in two sentences

### Changed
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Content Strategy Evolution synced through v0.8.22, added v0.8.23 entry
- **CLAUDE.md** — Version bump v0.8.22 → v0.8.23

## [0.8.22] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **CLAUDE.md** — SVG subtitle constraint was misleading: said subtitles "must match role titles in Open To section" but subtitles are brand identity titles (what James *is*), not job targets (what he's *seeking*). Clarified to prevent future agents from "fixing" intentional divergence
- **README.md** — Repo Setup replication step 3 referenced nonexistent `:root` CSS variables and was vague about which `<text>` elements to edit. Now cites exact class names (`sub`, `tag`) and specific hex values

### Added
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Metric Verification Commands: one-liner shell commands for checking each of the 13 Sync Map metrics against their source of truth (GitHub API, tokei, jq, vitest). Includes rate-limit note for unauthenticated GitHub API calls

### Changed
- **README.md** — Featured Projects grid: replaced `passion-site` (static HTML site) with `passion-memory-server` (MCP server powering the ecosystem) — stronger technical proof for the portfolio
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Content Strategy Evolution synced through v0.8.20, added v0.8.21 entry
- **CLAUDE.md** — Version bump v0.8.20 → v0.8.21

## [0.8.20] - 2026-03-26

### Changed
- **README.md** — PACT Dashboard descriptions updated across 4 locations (Currently Building, Featured Projects, All 33 Projects, ecosystem diagram) to reflect auto-select engine — viewport-aware embed selection with `computeEntryTiming`, `freezeActivityMap`, `maxSeverity` rules

## [0.8.19] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Layout map section count: "9 visible + 6 collapsed" → 8 visible — the showcase zone is embedded within Currently Building via HTML comment markers, not a standalone section. Previous count inflated the visible section number since v0.7.2
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Content Strategy Evolution: stuck at v0.8.17 as "(current)", missing v0.8.18 entry — now synced through v0.8.19

### Added
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Version Milestones quick-reference table: 9-row summary of the 52-entry Content Strategy arc — shows the growth→trim→stabilize pattern (peak 760 lines at v0.6.0, trimmed to 301 at v0.7.0, steady ~390 since)
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Clarifying note under layout map explaining that daily status and showcase zones are embedded within Currently Building, not standalone sections

## [0.8.17] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Metrics Sync Map: 4 new metrics tracked — PACT Component Count (`121`, 5 locations), Approval Rate (`89.9%`, 4 locations), PACT Test Count (`695`, 4 locations), fcpxml Tool Count (`53`, 2 locations). Total tracked metrics now 13 (was 9)
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Quick Reference: added entries for bumping component count and approval rate (the two most frequently drifting new metrics)
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Maintenance Checklist: added Sync Map completeness check (all 13 metrics consistent across documented locations)
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Content Strategy Evolution: synced through v0.8.17

## [0.8.16] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Hard Problems count: "6 deep-dive war stories" → 7 (cinematic hero orchestration was added in v0.8.15 but count wasn't bumped)
- **README.md** — Repo Setup editability matrix: CHANGELOG.md listed as "Human only" but agents write to it every version — corrected to "Human + Agent"

### Added
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Metrics Sync Map: added ecosystem test count (`1,400+`, 2 locations) and release velocity (`190`, 2 locations) — both metrics appear in multiple README sections but were missing from the sync map, risking stale-number drift

## [0.8.13] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Design Language color palette: Orchid hex was `#A855F7` (never used anywhere) — corrected to `#A78BFA` to match actual signature.svg secondary color; updated usage description to reflect real SVG element usage (subtitles, arrows, electrons, nucleus ring)

### Added
- **signature.svg** — Self-documenting header block: color contract, 8-phase animation sequence, dimension/theme specs, edit safety notes — eliminates dependency on FOR_DARE.md for developers opening the SVG directly
