## [0.8.35] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- **README.md** — Removed duplicate 3-column table header from file inventory in Repo Setup section — stale remnant from pre-v0.8.34 header upgrade caused malformed table rendering on GitHub (3-column header + 4-column data rows)

### Fixed
- **README.md** — Recurring broken showcase URL (3rd occurrence: v0.6.17, v0.8.10, v0.8.32): Passion Agent wrote `TdotsSolutionsz Music Video Portfolio` with literal spaces in GitHub URL — guaranteed 404. Corrected to hyphenated slug `tdotssolutionsz-portfolio`

### Added
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Content Strategy Evolution: added v0.8.32 entry, marked as current

- **CLAUDE.md** — Version bump v0.8.25 → v0.8.26

## [0.8.25] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **signature.svg** — Stale header comment: "Subtitle text must match 'Open To' roles" contradicted CLAUDE.md v0.8.22 fix. Subtitles are brand identity titles, not job targets. Corrected to match the established constraint
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Hard Problems count drift: listed "7 deep-dive war stories" but README has 8 entries after the v0.8.24 async cleanup addition. Updated to 8

### Added
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Version Milestones: added v0.8.24 row (React hooks cleanup, SVG instruction sharpening)
- **FOR_DARE.md** — Content Strategy Evolution: synced through v0.8.24, added v0.8.25 entry as current

## [0.8.22] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **CLAUDE.md** — SVG subtitle constraint was misleading: said subtitles "must match role titles in Open To section" but subtitles are brand identity titles (what James *is*), not job targets (what he's *seeking*). Clarified to prevent future agents from "fixing" intentional divergence
- **README.md** — Repo Setup replication step 3 referenced nonexistent `:root` CSS variables and was vague about which `<text>` elements to edit. Now cites exact class names (`sub`, `tag`) and specific hex values

### Added
