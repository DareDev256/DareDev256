# Hey, I'm James Dare 👋

**Creative Technologist | AI Product Builder | Former Music Video Director**

I directed **350+ music videos** for artists like **Chief Keef, Migos, and Masicka**. Built **KushdUp Filmsz** and sold the platform to **6ixBuzz** (now 3M+ followers). Earned a **gold record**. Pioneered cross-connections between the Canadian and US hip-hop scenes.

Now I build AI-powered tools, interactive 3D web experiences, and automation systems.
